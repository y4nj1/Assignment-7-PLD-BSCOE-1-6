# Create a program that check if password is valid
# The password is valid if all criteria are met:
# a. Greater than 15 letters
# b. Have at least one capital letter
# c. Have at least one number
# d. Have at least one special char (!@#$%^&*()_+ etc)
# ex.
# input: P@ssw0rd+P@ssw0rd
# output: Valid
# Tip: loop through each character of the input then process it letter by letter

# steps:
# 1. ask for password
password = input("Enter your password here: ")

# 2. check for capital letters, numbers, special characters

# 3. display if password is valid or not
